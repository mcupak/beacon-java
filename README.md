##What it is
This project contains the BDK (beacon development kit) for Java (EE) developers. The BDK provides all of the tools required to create a basic rest implementation for a beacon almost straight out of the box with only minimal set up required.
Users can extend the BDK to make it fit within their own project, or use it as is defining their own service to retrieve data from their preferred data source.

##System requirements
All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later, Maven 3.0 or later. Since the project is Java EE based, an application server with support for Java EE 7 is needed to deploy the application (e.g. JBoss EAP or WildFly).

##Modules
1. [beacon-java-core](/beacon-java-core)
    Contains core classes and functions shared across modules in the BJDK.
2. [beacon-java-rest](/beacon-java-rest)
    Rest implementation of a beacon, configured to run on a JBOSS server.
3. [sample-beacon-adapter](/sample-beacon-adapter)
    Sample beacon adapter implementation

## Beacon Specification
The BDK implements the beacon specification and relies on the data models generated by the beacon schema. At the moment the dependency is not currently listed on maven central but can be retrived from the [beacon teams git hub repository](https://github.com/ga4gh/beacon-team). 

To retrieve the dependency:

```
git clone https://github.com/ga4gh/beacon-team
cd beacon-team
mvn clean install
```

## How it Works
The project provides the following:

- Rest API
- sample beacon service implementation
- sample test suite

##How to run it
Build the project:

    mvn clean install

Start the JBoss server:

    $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh

Deploy beacon-java-rest:

    cp beacon-java-rest/target/beacon-java-rest.war $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/

The application should now be running on <http://localhost:8080/beacon-java>.

In order to run the tests from beacon-java-rest in a managed (remote) container, use the test-managed (test-remote) Maven profile. Example:

    mvn test -Ptest-managed

##Creating a beacon
Beacon REST API uses Beacon Service to retrieve the beacon data. The BDK ships with a sample Beacon Service that uses sample data.
The sample Beacon Service is intended to be a placeholder to allow the tests to be run, and to give the user an idea of how to implement a beacon.

Once you are ready, implement your own [beacon-service](https://github.com/mcupak/beacon-service) project to use query own data.
To switch to your own Beacon Service, simply replace the service dependency in the beacon-java-rest's pom with your own.

The Rest API provides the following endpoints upon deployment of your beacon:

    http://localhost:8080/beacon-java - information about your beacon
    http://localhost:8080/beacon-java/query - access to query service
